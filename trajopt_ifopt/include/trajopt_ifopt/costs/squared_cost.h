/**
 * @brief This class converts a constraint to a cost with a sum squared error
 *
 * IFOPT costs differ from constraints in 2 main ways.
 * 1) Constraints have multiple rows where a cost is simply a value (the sum of all of the costs)
 * 2) Constraints have bounds that they must be within. Costs should simply be as close to 0 as possible
 *
 * This class converts the bounds to a target and then sets the value to be the weighted squared sum of the distances
 * from that target. The result is that the value (GetCost) is a single double and the jacobian (GetJacobian) is a
 * single row (1 x n_vars)
 *
 * Given a constraint: g(x) with some bounds: upper_ and lower_
 *
 * The target of the cost is set to the average of the upper and lower bounds:
 *
 *     target = 1/2 * (upper_ + lower_)
 *
 * and
 *
 *     error(x) = g(x) - target
 *
 * Let
 *
 *     derror(x)/dx = dg(x)/dx = J(x)
 *
 * The squared cost is defined as
 *
 *     cost(x) = error.transpose() * W * error
 *
 * where W is the diagonal matrix of the cost weights
 *
 * Then
 *
 *     dcost(x)/dx = 2 * error.transpose() * W * J(x)
 *
